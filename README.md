# Uber Ride End-to-End ETL Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of Uber data, utilizing various tools and technologies to gain insights and create visual representations. The project was executed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and included data storage, processing, and visualization steps.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Storage:** Used for storing raw and processed data.
- **Python:** Employed for data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.
- **Compute Instance:** Utilized for running Python scripts and managing data processing tasks.
- **Mage Data Pipeline Tool:** Facilitated the creation and management of data pipelines.
- **BigQuery:** Enabled efficient querying and analysis of large datasets.
- **Looker Studio:** Used for creating interactive dashboards and visualizing data insights.

## Project Components

1. **Data Storage:** 
   - The raw Uber data was stored in GCP Storage buckets. This ensured scalability and easy access for further processing.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Python scripts were used to clean and preprocess the data. This involved handling missing values, normalizing data formats, and preparing the data for analysis.

3. **Data Processing:**
   - The cleaned data was processed using Mage Data Pipeline Tool to automate and streamline the data workflow.

4. **Data Analysis:**
   - BigQuery was employed to perform complex queries and derive insights from the processed data. Various SQL queries were written to extract meaningful patterns and trends.

5. **Data Visualization:**
   - The results from the data analysis were visualized using Looker Studio. Interactive dashboards were created to showcase key findings and insights.

## Key Insights

- **Ride Patterns:** Analysis of ride patterns over different times of the day and days of the week.
- **Geographical Distribution:** Insights into the geographical distribution of rides, identifying hotspots and areas with high demand.
- **Customer Behavior:** Understanding customer preferences and behavior based on ride data.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Evaluation of operational metrics to identify areas for improvement in Uberâ€™s service.
